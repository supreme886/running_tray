# ðŸ§° running_tray

a cross-platform Qt-based desktop application that implements a plugin-based system tray manager. The application serves as a host for extensible system tray plugins, with primary implementations including a CPU monitoring plugin that displays animated system tray icons and a weather plugin that shows animated weather conditions.
Project inspiration and some icon resources are borrowed from [RunCat_for_windows](https://github.com/Kyome22/RunCat_for_windows).

> ðŸ“– Online documentation is automatically generated by [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/supreme886/running_tray), supporting structure diagrams and natural language Q&A.

**Language**: [English](README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](README-CN.md)

# Inspiration

The running_tray project draws inspiration and some icon resources from:

[RunCat_for_windows](https://github.com/Kyome22/RunCat_for_windows)

This project has greatly inspired us with its simple tray animations and lightweight running mechanism.  
We appreciate its excellent design and open-source spirit, and have made improvements and extensions based on it.
